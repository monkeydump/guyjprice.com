<h2>Artist Influences</h2>
<p>My abstract work is influenced largly by the american abstract expresionists of the 1940's and 50's like Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still and I admire greatly artists such as William Turner whom I have always in mind when painting seascapes.</p>
<p>Contemporary influences include John White and Martin Spall.</p>
