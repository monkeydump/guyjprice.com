      <p style="margin-top:0;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"Chris has re-designed my website with a fresh modern look. The result works equally well be it viewed on a desktop PC, a tablet or a smartphone. I have received many compliments on both, from a content as well as an informative point of view. I would recommend Chris to anyone looking to project a clear, concise - and amusing - message to their market".</span><br /><br /><br /><br />

Chris has breathed new life into it by swapping the windows operating system for 'Linux'. I was apprehensive at first but now really pleased with the results!"</span><br /><br /><br /><br />
