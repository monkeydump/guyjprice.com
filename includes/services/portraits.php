<h2>Portraits</h2>
<p>
    We the people love portraits because they are human, real, emotional, and tell us about life.
    All of which I pour into my work. Constantly striving for the best I'm proud of what I create
    but always hungry to do better! A commissioned portrait from me will intrigue & delight, be it
    a family portrait, or just the kids.

    Mobile phones, digital cameras - these days people have the capability to capture hundreds
    of photographs. These inevitably get squirrelled away on yet other tech devices, viewed occasionally. 
    It's fantastic! Photography is a mirror-like reflection of reality. A painting, however, adds a
    whole different dimension... [you can write far better copy than I can in this subject Guy, but
    you get the idea]

<!--<p>There is something particularly special about adorning your wall with a painting.. blah
blah blah - give me one of your photos & a bunch of cash & I'll convert a photo
of your hideous children or animal & knock up some arty representation which you can show
off to your friends.</p>
